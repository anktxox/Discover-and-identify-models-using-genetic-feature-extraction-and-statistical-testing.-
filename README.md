development and identification of models through the utilization of statistical testing and the extraction of genetic programming features.

One major disadvantage of many machine learning-based regression models is that they are difficult to comprehend and explain. Mechanism-based first-principles models are desirable due to their interpretability. However, because they are sometimes difficult to construct, machine learning-based black-box models are understandably appealing. We provide a genetic algorithm-based machine learning system that automatically finds mechanistic models from data while requiring only little human direction. 
This technique has the benefit of producing basic, interpretable characteristics that may be utilized to identify model shapes and fundamental mechanisms commonly seen in chemical engineering. Our system is demonstrated through case studies in reaction kinetics and transport phenomena, with a discussion of strengths and limits.
